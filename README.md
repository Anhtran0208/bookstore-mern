# ReadaThon Bookstore

## Summary
**ReadaThon Bookstore** is a complete booklist that I have read to self-study CS knowledge and prepare for internships. I just switched to CS major last December, and I spent a lot of time
reading books, doing personal projects, and learning online courses to improve my technical knowledge. 
As a result, I successfully landed 2 internships in the freshman summer although I had no coding experience before pursuing CS.
This book guide, hopefully, can give you motivation to keep trying and eventually, hard work will be paid off!!!
